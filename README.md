# Contextionary

> The contextionary powers the semantic, context-based searches in weaviate.

**WIP: The contextionary is currently still part of
[weaviate](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate) itself, but in the
process of being extracted into its own microservice. For details, see [this
issue](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/issues/730#issuecomment-471159177).**
